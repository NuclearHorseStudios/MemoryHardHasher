MemoryHardHasher
================

An implementation of memory hard hashing in C++.  

Created as an exercise in C++, use at your own risk.   
I'm certain there's all sorts of shit wrong with 
it.  

It all seems to work though.  Assumes OpenSSL/SHA256.

**INSTALLATION**

     $ make

**EXAMPLE USAGE / OUTPUT**

Pass a string to hash and a strength.  Strength is used to determine the number 
of iterations of the hashed password to use to fill out memory.  Memory usage 
will be correlated with 2^strength.  Strength of 24 uses about 16.7MB of memory.
